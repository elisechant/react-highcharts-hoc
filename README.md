# React Highcharts Higher Order Component

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-hoc.svg?branch=master&)](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-hoc)

A HOC to reactify Highcharts for you app.


## Problems this library sets out to solve

1. Highcharts does not translate to the ES6+ ecosystem, as the Highcharts constructor is not global. Therefore, you can not apply application wide configuration to Highcharts.

2. Highcharts depends on the DOM existing to render.


## Getting started

1. Add the module to your React app:

`npm install react-highcharts-hoc`


2. Follow the instructions how to use it (coming soon).






HOC provides the service
Often they don't have names that remind you on a connection between the HOCs and the services they connect.


 context instead, can get delivered by any ancestor component. Like ServiceProviderA in our example.
 But React now doesn't simply pass the context to every child component, you have to explicitly ask for it. And this asking is what you can implement in a HOC.
